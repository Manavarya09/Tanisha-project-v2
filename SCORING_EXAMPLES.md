# Yes/No/Partial Scoring Examples

## How Scoring Works

### Single Pillar Examples

#### Example 1: All "Yes" Answers
If a pillar has 10 questions and all answers are "Yes" (value: 5):
- Sum: 5 × 10 = 50
- Average: 50 / 10 = 5
- Percentage: (5 / 5) × 100 = **100%**
- Level: **Exceptional**

#### Example 2: All "Partial" Answers
If a pillar has 10 questions and all answers are "Partial" (value: 3):
- Sum: 3 × 10 = 30
- Average: 30 / 10 = 3
- Percentage: (3 / 5) × 100 = **60%**
- Level: **Developing**

#### Example 3: All "No" Answers
If a pillar has 10 questions and all answers are "No" (value: 1):
- Sum: 1 × 10 = 10
- Average: 10 / 10 = 1
- Percentage: (1 / 5) × 100 = **20%**
- Level: **Needs Improvement**

#### Example 4: Mixed Answers (Realistic)
If a pillar has 10 questions with:
- 5 "Yes" (5 × 5 = 25)
- 3 "Partial" (3 × 3 = 9)
- 2 "No" (2 × 1 = 2)

Calculation:
- Sum: 25 + 9 + 2 = 36
- Average: 36 / 10 = 3.6
- Percentage: (3.6 / 5) × 100 = **72%**
- Level: **Proficient**

### Overall Score Calculation

The overall score is the average of all 7 pillar percentages:

#### Example: Company Assessment
- Strategy & Leadership: 80% (Advanced)
- AI Organization & Culture: 60% (Developing)
- Business Readiness: 75% (Proficient)
- Data Readiness: 70% (Proficient)
- Infrastructure Readiness: 65% (Developing)
- People & Skills: 55% (Basic)
- AI Governance & Ethics: 70% (Proficient)

**Overall Score**: (80 + 60 + 75 + 70 + 65 + 55 + 70) / 7 = **67.9%** → **Developing**

## Score Distribution Guide

| Answer Pattern | Approximate Percentage | Performance Level |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Mostly Yes, some Partial | 85-95% | Exceptional/Advanced |
| Equal Yes & Partial | 70-80% | Proficient/Advanced |
| Mostly Partial, some Yes | 60-70% | Developing/Proficient |
| Equal Partial & No | 40-50% | Basic/Needs Improvement |
| Mostly No, some Partial | 25-35% | Needs Improvement |
| All No | 20% | Needs Improvement |

## Benefits of 1-3-5 Scoring

1. **Clear Differentiation**: The gaps (1→3→5) create meaningful score differences
2. **Partial Credit**: "Partial" (3) gives 60%, showing progress without full achievement
3. **Avoids Neutrality Issues**: No "middle" option that users might default to
4. **Intuitive Labels**: Yes/No/Partial is clearer than 5-point agreement scales
5. **Consistent Math**: Maintains mathematical integrity for averaging and reporting
