# Assessment Scoring System Update

## Overview
Updated the AI Readiness Assessment from a 5-point scale (1-5) to a simpler **Yes/No/Partial** system that works for both free and paid assessments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Question Options (assessmentLogic.ts)
**Previous System:**
- 1: Strongly Disagree / Not at all
- 2: Disagree / Minimal
- 3: Neutral / Moderate
- 4: Agree / Significant
- 5: Strongly Agree / Extensive

**New System:**
- **1**: No
- **3**: Partial
- **5**: Yes

### 2. Scoring Logic
The calculation remains mathematically sound:
- Each answer is scored as 1, 3, or 5
- Average score per pillar = sum of all answers / number of questions
- Percentage score = (average / 5) × 100

**Example Calculations:**
- All "Yes" (5) → 100%
- All "Partial" (3) → 60%
- All "No" (1) → 20%
- Mix of Yes (5) and Partial (3) → 80%
- Mix of Partial (3) and No (1) → 40%

### 3. UI Updates (AssessmentForm.tsx)
Updated the question rendering to display:
- Radio button option: "No" (value: 1)
- Radio button option: "Partial" (value: 3)
- Radio button option: "Yes" (value: 5)

### 4. Applies to Both Assessment Types
- **Free Assessment**: Uses Yes/No/Partial
- **Paid Assessment**: Uses Yes/No/Partial
- Both use the same scoring logic and options

## Performance Levels
The performance level thresholds remain unchanged:
- **90%+**: Exceptional
- **80-89%**: Advanced
- **70-79%**: Proficient
- **60-69%**: Developing
- **50-59%**: Basic
- **<50%**: Needs Improvement

## Benefits of New System
1. **Simpler for Users**: Easier to understand than 5-point scale
2. **Clear Intent**: Yes/No/Partial is more intuitive than agreement scales
3. **Better Differentiation**: The 1-3-5 spacing provides good score distribution
4. **Consistent**: Same options for all questions across both assessment types
5. **Mathematically Sound**: Scoring still produces meaningful percentages

## All 7 Pillars Supported
The scoring system works across all 7 AI Readiness pillars:
1. Strategy & Leadership
2. AI Organization & Culture
3. Business Readiness
4. Data Readiness
5. Infrastructure Readiness
6. People & Skills
7. AI Governance & Ethics
